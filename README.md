FireAware: 
=======

## How to try out the server
1. Go to eclipse.
2. File -> Import -> Maven project -> Existing maven project -> select fire-api in the backend folder
3. Go to src/main/java -> xb3.fire.api -> and run FireApiApp.java (PLEASE WAIT UNTIL ITS DONE LOADING)
4. Now go to frontend directory and open the index.html 
5. You can now view the map of buildings (IF NOTHING, PLEASE ENSURE THAT THE JAVA PROJECT HAS LOADED BEFORE YOU OPEN, YOU MAY HAVE TO REFRESH)
6. Features: You can search, it can view all (might be slow on old computer as a lot of buildings), or you can view filtered buildings that have not been inspected in a view
7. You can also add 5 buildings to the sidebar by clicking on a building and pressing add
(Note: you must add 5 buildings, nothing less)
8. Once 5 buildings have been selected, you can click to find an optimal path (our graphing algorithm) (MAY TAKE 20 SECONDS IF YOUR COMPUTER IS OLDER)
